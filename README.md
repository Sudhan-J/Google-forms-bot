# Google-forms-bot using Selenium webdriver

This is a bot used to automate the filling of Google forms using selenium
now, I have used pyautogui as well for date picker reson being it's almost not possible to automate using selenium
it is possible using jQuery which is not used in google forms,Hence the reason for pyautogui
## the above rep includes:
chrome-driver executable,\
the python code,\
Screenshots for pyautogui to recognize the date picker.
